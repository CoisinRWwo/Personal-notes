## ★ If虛拟语句的省略( 倒装) 用法:

**如果条件状语从句的谓语中有 were, had 等，就可以省略 if , 并将were, had放到句首;如没有，则不能省略if。**

例:If I were you, I should study English.

​     Were I you, I should study English.

If you had been here earlier, you would have seen him.

→Had you been here earlier, ...



## 二、四种要从句中用 (should) + V原形的动词

***主动: ( should) + do***

***被动: (should) + be+ done***



表示建议: ***suggest*** / recommend/ advise/ propose

表示主张: ***insist***(坚持)/ maintain

表示要求: ***demand***(要求)/ ***require***/ ***request***/ desire

表示命令: command/ order



## 三、It is +形容词+ that... + (should) +V原形

It's ***important (necessary /*** essential / advisable) that...

这个句型表示说话人的意见、要求等。

例:It is essential that there should be enough food and clothing for the winter.



## 四、wish引导从句中的虚拟语气

“wish+宾从”表示很难实现或不能实现的愿望，“但愿..."

1、***对现在事实虚拟，从句的谓语V.用过去式 (be用were)***

例句: I wish(it were spring all the year round.

2、***对过去事情相反，从句的谓语V.用 had+过去分词***

例句: We wish we had arrived there two hours earlier.

3、**对将来事实虚拟，从句的谓语V.用would+动词原形**

例句: We wish you would spend the winter vacation with us.



➢与wish同用 的词:

1) ***if only “要.....就好了”***

If only I had taken his advice. =I wish I had taken his advice

2. ***as if / as though “好像,似乎”***

例: She looks as if/though she were ill.

3) ***would rather“宁愿.....***

would rather... than...

“宁愿.....而不愿.....不用虚拟(后都接动词原形)



含蓄条件句

虚拟条件句中的条件从句有时不表出来，只暗含在上下文中，这种句子叫做含蓄条件句。

含蓄条件句大体有两种情况:

①条件暗含在介词短语连词副词

如***without , bu't for , but , or , otherwise***中

②条件暗含在上下文中

Otherwise + world have done 

解题时要把握语境，分析与何种事实(过去、现在和将来)相反。
