[考点一]

句首为否定或半否定的词语

如no, not, never, seldom, neither, nor, little等开头的句子中，主谓要倒装。

***no sooner..than“一... .就.....”***

***hardly... when“一. ...就...”***

***not only.. but also“不仅.....而......***

****** 

***no sooner + had + …… than***

hardly..... when



2. **here,now, then, there等词置于句首的倒装结构**

Here is your book.

Then came the moment when we succeed.

我们胜利的时刻到来了。

注意: here, now, there置于句首时句子必须用一般现在

当主语为人称代词时，动词不需要倒装，

如: There( she) comes.



3. 虚拟条件状语从句省去if的倒装结构

**Should he make** the same mistake again,he would get punished.

**Had I known**, | would have told you.

**Were I to attend** the meeting in Shanghai,

I would fly there tomorrow.

***注意:虚拟条件状语从句中，如有were,should 或助动词 had 时，可省去if，并将这些词置于句首，形成倒装结构。***



比较: Only five passengers survived the accident.

​    事故中只有五位旅客生存下来。

Only in this way can we lose weight.

只有这种方法我们才能减肥。

***注意: only 如不在句首，only修饰的不是状语则不倒装 。***

 

★not until“直到......放句首同only倒装用法

例: Not until midnight did it stop raining.直到半夜雨才停

   Not until the child fell asleep did the mother leave the room. 

母亲一直到孩子入睡后才离开房间。

 

2.具有否定意义的副词或短语置于句首作状语时的倒装结构

(1)表示否定意义的词，如:

***hardly , little , never , not , not until , nowhere , rarely , scarcely , seldom ***等

Never have | read this book.

Seldom did | make any mistake during my past six years of working here.

(2)含有no的词组，如:

***at no time , by no means , in no case , on no account , under no circumstances***等

On no account must we give up easily.

Under no circumstances should we see them again.

 

(3)so,such等置于句首加强语气时的倒装结构置于句首引发倒装结构的短语

***So/such...that, to such a degree, to such a point, to such an extent, to such extremes***

So cold was it that I couldn't sleep at all.

Such was a good chance that we mustn't miss it. 

To such an extent did the temperature rise

that the firemen had to leave the burning building.

 

***(4)由as, be, however, though引导的让步状语从句的倒装结构被强调的部分置于句首，而非主谓倒装***

Hard as he studied, he failed in the exam.

Be she poor or rich, | will still love her. 不管她贫穷还是富有，我都会爱她。

However great the pitfalls (are), we must

do our best to succeed. 不管风险有多大，我们一定要尽力取得成功。

Poor though she is, her life is happy.

***n / adj. + as + 主语 + 谓语***

 

 

(6)表示方位的副词away, down, in, off,out, up等置于句首时的倒装结构

特点:通常 与come, go等表示位置转移的动词连用，达到生动刻画的效果

河水顺流而下

Down went the wall with a crash.

墙哗啦一-声塌了下来。

Up went the flag.

 

 

(7)作地点状语的介词短语置于句首时的倒装特点:其后所接谓语一般是不及物动词，如:come, exist, lie, live, run, sit, stand, walk等
