### 比较非谓语动词形式todo在句中的成分:

1. **To learn English** well is important for us. ( **主语**)

2. I want **to arrive** there as soon as possible. ( **宾语**)

3. The important thing is **to finish** the work on time. (**表语**)

***非谓语动词除了不能做谓语外，其他的成分都可以担当***

## 一、动词不定式 to do

其形式是 “ **to + 动词原形** ”。to是不定式符号，其否定式是在 to 前面加上 not , never 等否定词。

如: ask sb. to do sth. --- a sk sb. not to do sth.

注意: look forward to doing sth. 期盼做某事(to 为介词)

**used to do sth.过去常常做某事(to? )**

**be used to doing sth.习惯做某事(to? )**



### A.做主语:

在不定式短语作主语的句子中，用it作形式所主语，而不把不定式短语放在句子的后面。

To tell a lie is not easy.  =  It's not easy to tell a lie.

To know everything is impossible. =  It's impossible to know everything.

★不定式做主语转换成: ***It is + adj. / n. ( of / for sb. ) to do sth.***

It is difficult for us to communicate with each other.

对我们来说相互交流太困难了
